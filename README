NAME
    Perinci::AccessUtil::Check - Utility module for Riap client/server

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Perinci::AccessUtil::Check (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-AccessUtil-Check), released on 2014-10-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::AccessUtil::Check qw(check_riap_res);
     my $res = check_riap_res([200,"OK"]);

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  check_riap_res($envres) => array
    Starting in Riap protocol v1.2, client is required to check and strip
    all "riap.*" keys in result metadata ("$envres->[3]"). This routine does
    just that.

    This routine is used by Riap client libraries, e.g.
    Perinci::Access::Lite, Perinci::Access::Perl, and
    Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client, Perinci::Access::Simple::Client.

    If there is no error, will return $envres with all "riap.*" keys already
    stripped. If there is an error, an error response will be returned
    instead. Either way, you can use the response returned by this function
    to user.

SEE ALSO
    Riap, Perinci::Access.
